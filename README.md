# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project is a software-controlled thermostat that regulates temperature based on user-defined settings. It interfaces with hardware components to read temperature data from a sensor and adjust heating or cooling accordingly. The goal is to create an efficient and reliable system that ensures optimal temperature control while maintaining energy efficiency.

What did you do particularly well?

I was able to implemented real-time temperature monitoring and control logic effectively. With a majority of the codebase supplied, I designed a modular and maintainable codebase, making it easy to expand or modify. Integrated GPIO and UART communication to interface with hardware components. I also ensured user-friendly interaction, allowing adjustments via input commands.

Where could you improve?

For areas of improvement, I could optimize response time for temperature fluctuations to improve efficiency. I could enhance error handling for unexpected sensor failures or hardware communication issues. It can also be improved by implementing a more advanced UI or connectivity options like a mobile app for remote control.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

My tools and resources would include a Raspberry Pi and GPIO/UART libraries for embedded system integration. Python for writing control logic and interfacing with hardware. Serial communication protocols to handle UART connections and online documentation and forums for troubleshooting embedded system challenges.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Important transferable skils from this project include my experience with GPIO and UART that will be useful in other hardware-interfacing projects. Understanding how software controls physical components is valuable in IoT and automation. Writing modular and scalable code is applicable across various development tasks. Also, diagnosing issues in hardware communication is a crucial skill for embedded systems development.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried to use clear and well-documented code, making it easy for others to understand and modify. I followed a modular approach, allowing components to be swapped or improved without affecting the entire system. I implemented error handling and logging, making sure that issues can be diagnosed efficiently and designed the system to be scalable, so future enhancements can be integrated with minimal changes.
